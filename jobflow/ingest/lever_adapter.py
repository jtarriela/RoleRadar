Lever adapter.

This module provides a function to fetch job listings from the
Lever recruitment platform.  Lever exposes a JSON endpoint for
public job postings at `https://api.lever.co/v1/postings/{slug}`.
The `slug` is the unique identifier for a company's Lever instance
(e.g. `databricks`).  The function returns a list of dicts with at
least a `job_id` and raw `html` for each posting.

The current implementation is a placeholder that returns an empty
list.  Replace the body with a proper HTTP request (e.g. using
`requests.get(f"https://api.lever.co/v1/postings/{slug}")`) and
HTML retrieval as needed.
