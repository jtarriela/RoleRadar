"""
Normalization subsystem for RoleRadar.

This package converts raw HTML pages into structured `JobRow`
instances and writes them to CSV files.  It also provides helper
functions to extract fields from HTML using ruleâ€‘based parsing and
optional LLM fallbacks when the heuristics fail.

The normalized CSV format is defined by the `JobRow` dataclass in
`schema.py`.  See the README for the list of required headers.
