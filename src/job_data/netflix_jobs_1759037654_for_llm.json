You’ll play a foundational role in establishing the practices used by hundreds of engineers and ML researchers across dozens of use cases. Our team is small and growing, so you’ll mentor incoming B&R engineers as they grow into their roles supporting our organization.\nTo be successful in this role, you must have a strong software engineering background, a keen sense of software design, and experience operating large CI/CD systems.\n### **Snapshot of projects you may work on:**\n* Help make foundational technology decisions with an eye toward large-scale repository management.\n* Define best practices for large-scale monorepos, influencing how hundreds of engineers work daily.\n* Anticipate and prepare for scaling opportunities as our repository grows beyond the capabilities of existing tools, such as build time reductions, flaky test handling, build tool migrations, and more.\n* Onboard existing repositories as they enter the monorepo, including harmonizing their homegrown toolchains with our standardized offers.\n* Expand B&R support to accommodate new languages. We currently support Java and Scala, and are expanding to Python.\n* Support teams with company-wide migrations and version upgrades, such as build and runtime environment versions and library versions.\n* Work alongside company-wide build experts to incorporate existing company-wide tools into our environment.\n* Create measurement harnesses to measure build performance, mean time to failure, and other critical developer velocity metrics.\n### **We would love to work with you if:**\n* You have at least four years of experience directly managing build, CI/CD, and release tooling, preferably in a monorepo context in which these offerings are provided as a service\n* You have proficiency in managing large projects in Gradle as well as cross-language build tools such as Bazel or Pants\n* You have experience developing build and release operations for large repositories featuring dozens to hundreds of independent but interlinked projects\n* You have extensive experience with Java and/or Python B&R methodologies\n* You have a passion for evolving B&R best practices in response to empirical performance and developer velocity measurements\nOur compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses.

When we do that well, Members value Netflix and continue to subscribe, despite the many other choices for entertainment. This team creates the data products that help measure this experience, track key KPIS, and support innovation decisions through A/B testing.

Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\n**The Opportunity**\nHave you ever wondered how we assess and decide how we account for content in our financial statements? Are you curious and invested in looking to contribute to automated workflows for Accounting? Do you enjoy reviewing and analyzing large data sets that are used to make critical business decisions? If yes, we are looking for you to join other stunning colleagues in Los Angeles who share a passion for continuing to build expertise in streamed content accounting.\nThis role provides you with the chance to join a team committed to transforming and redefining the perception of entertainment and how it can be enjoyed through the Netflix service. With continued investment in a slate of content, including original productions, content licensing, and international expansion, it's a great time for you to join Netflix.\nThis role is based in our Hollywood office, reporting to the management team in Content Accounting.\n**Responsibilities:**\n* Based in our Hollywood office, reporting to the management team in Content Accounting.\n* Part of the team responsible for the financial integrity of the company's content commitments, assets (capitalization), liabilities (payments), and expenses (amortization).\n* Prepare and review monthly accounting entries, reconciliations, CFO metrics, and other ad hoc analyses.\n* Management and accounting (in proprietary systems) of content license contracts and understanding the full cost of each produced show, with a focus on ensuring appropriate accounting by researching guidance.\n* Analyze content agreements and transactions (e.g. licensing contracts, talent deals, etc.), to interpret contractual terms and understand the application of our accounting policies.\n* Identify and drive process improvements and own projects such as accounting policy review.\n* Manage cross-functional relationships with teams outside of Content Accounting, including those across finance and content acquisition organizations.\n* As Netflix continues its content expansion, the accounting and operational complexities are also growing. There are new challenges we're facing, and there's plenty of fun we're having. Come be a part of it and help make a positive impact!\n**Qualities We’re Looking For:**\n* Fundamentals of Accounting: We'd like you to have 3+ years of experience under your belt, backed by a bachelor's degree in accounting and/or finance. While not required, it’s preferred that you are on track for completion of (or have already completed) obtaining a CPA license or a postgraduate degree.\n* Attention to detail + love for data - We pride ourselves on producing high-quality work, scrutinizing important numbers and formulas for accuracy, and using spreadsheets and system data to reconcile accounts and solve problems and questions; we like our accountants to love Excel pivot tables and be unphased by large data sets.\n* Enthusiasm and quick learning - Enthusiasm for designing and building new accounting systems and making improvements to existing systems. Prior work with contract review (revenue, leases, or other complex documents), data entry and analysis, research, and other problem-solving tasks is helpful, but we understand you probably have never done content accounting. That’s OK with us because we’ll teach you as long as you’re excited about learning.\n* Curiosity and passion - Our team members ask probing questions, challenge the status quo, make changes to improve processes, and have fun while doing it all; a positive attitude and never settling for “good enough” is key, along with adding to our unique company culture.\n* You have strong communication skills (both written and oral) and are viewed as a strong cross-functional business partner. You should also have a strong accounting background and be comfortable navigating technical accounting guidance.\n* Collaborate inclusively - Partner with team members and authentically recognize, understand, and appreciate differences, and connect across these differences by being mutually adaptive.\n* Adaptable—You must be comfortable with an ever-changing ecosystem of content, finance, and accounting issues and projects.\n* You embrace and advocate the Netflix culture and our long-term view.\nOur compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses. You choose each year how much of your compensation you want in salary versus stock options. To determine your personal top of market compensation, we rely on market indicators and consider your specific job family, background, skills, and experience to determine your compensation in the market range. The range for this role is $50,000 - $240,000.\nWe are an equal-opportunity employer and celebrate diversity, recognizing that diversity\n* ### General Description\n* ### Essential Cookies\n* ### Performance and Functionality Cookies\n* ### Advertising Cookies\n#### General Description\nThis cookie tool will help you understand the use of cookies on this website, and how you can control the use of these cookies.\nPrivacy settings in most browsers allow you to prevent your browser from accepting some or all cookies, notify you when it receives a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether.

From offering gameplay to non-members and building guest account flows, to establishing how player handles and history show up across Netflix—it all starts here.\n**This role is uniquely positioned to:**\n* Explore how we serve players before they become members.\n* Shape the way we communicate the value of the game and/or catalogue in access flows.\n* Build the identity frameworks that connect play, profile, and presence.\n* It’s a strategic and creative challenge—with business impact at its core.\n**What You Will Do**\n* Develop a vision for how players access games and identify themselves across all surfaces of Netflix Games.\n* Design experiences for non-member access, guest accounts, login, and identity creation—balancing platform policy requirements with player delight.\n* Define how Netflix’s account and identity model evolves to support social, multiplayer, and cross-device gaming in ways that feel native to our brand.\n* Collaborate across functions—PM, engineering, legal, and platform partners—to explore new models for access and membership value.\n* Contribute to the definition of monetization strategies (e.g., upsell moments, free-to-play considerations) by shaping how those moments come to life in product.\n* Partner closely with the Growth design team to ensure games are aligned with the broader Netflix roadmap—while also advocating for the unique needs of players.\n* Help define the future of player profiles and personalization—guiding how we evolve handles, icons, player hubs, and public identity with an eye on future social opportunities.\n* Navigate ambiguity with clarity—bringing design leadership, structure, and momentum to a space still being defined.\n**What We’re Looking For**\n* 8+ years of product design experience, including end-to-end ownership of complex, platform-level initiatives.\n* A strong portfolio demonstrating cross-platform product thinking, elegant UX, and ability to solve for both business and user needs.\n* Experience with account systems, identity, access, growth, or platform design—especially in regulated or technically nuanced environments (e.g. mobile games, app store compliance, login/auth).\n* A systems thinker who can connect the dots between player experience, platform policy, and technical requirements.\n* Excellent communication and storytelling skills; able to synthesize complexity and inspire partners across functions.\n* A balance of vision and execution: you can dream up what’s possible and ship what’s necessary.\n**Even Better If You Have…**\n* Experience with gaming ecosystems, live service products, or entertainment platforms.\n* Comfort designing with policy constraints or across regulated platforms like Google Play or the App Store.\n* A passion for player identity, representation, and expression.\n**Why You'll Love Our Team**\n* Opportunity to Build: This is a chance to shape how people experience Netflix Games from day one—not just the games they play, but how they get there.\n* Strategic and Creative Balance: You’ll work on deeply impactful problems that require deep systems thinking, creativity, and business savvy.\n* Collaborative Culture: Join a thoughtful, passionate, and fun team that believes games are better together.\n* Freedom and Trust: Bring your vision to life with autonomy and strong cross-functional support.\n* Growth-Oriented: We support career development through mentorship, stretch opportunities, and learning budgets.\nAt Netflix, we carefully consider a wide range of compensation factors to determine your personal top of market.

Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\n# The Role\nThe Shared Client Foundations team builds UI architecture and frameworks which can be leveraged by product engineers, across the iOS, Android, TV and Web client platforms. These frameworks help UI engineers access data, configure applications, create server-driven UIs and understand how their clients are operating in production.\nThis role will be focused on Android, requiring familiarity with iOS UI architecture and frameworks. However, we believe strong engineering aptitude transcends stacks, and providing the opportunity to explore UI development on other platforms is a unique aspect of this role.\nWe’re currently building solutions with Swift on iOS and use GraphQL as our shared data access technology. We use Kotlin on Android, and JavaScript/TypeScript on TV & Web.\nSome of the things we’re excited to be working on currently:\n* Building the ideal cross-platform data access architecture for Netflix applications\n* Creating a Server Driven UI architecture and tooling which accelerates app experimentation\n* Delivering frameworks to simplify feature-configuration based UI development\nIn this role you’ll:\n* Independently scope, design, implement and deliver project tracks in the areas above\n* Weigh business, product and architectural trade-offs to influence your software designs\n* Have a stunning set of teammates to draw on, to deepen your iOS UI architecture expertise\n* Collaborate with a broad set of client, server, foundational and product engineers across Netflix\n* Support product engineers building the Netflix application on top of your framework solutions, and supporting the application in production\nAll of our projects allow you to explore aspects of product development, architecture and tooling.\n# The Team\nThe Shared Client Foundations team builds shared UI architecture and frameworks which power the Netflix iOS, Android, TV and Web applications on devices ranging from mobile phones, tablets, web browsers, to streaming sticks, cable boxes, Smart TVs and game consoles.\nDiverse and inclusive teams are strong teams. We encourage those with varied identities, backgrounds, and experiences to apply. We believe that creating a sense of belonging allows us to be our best selves, which in turn helps us produce our best work. We rely on our unique individual strengths to help each other grow.\nWe have a distributed team across the US, while trying to maintain some pacific time overlap. With some teammates working remotely from the east coast, and some co-located in the Los Gatos, CA office. The team is committed to being ‘remote-inclusive’ and believe it’s about the work you do, and the relationships you build. Where you can best do that from is up to you.\n# You\nPeople who do well on the team are self-motivated engineers with a passion for building solutions rooted in business and customer needs. Analytical and technical skills form a solid foundation. But more importantly, we look for engineers who understand that there are rarely any absolutes when it comes to technology. The curiosity to engage in discussions about use cases, prioritization and technical challenges with colleagues, while thoughtfully weighing trade-offs across multiple solutions is a skill we value highly. As is the desire to continually learn, grow and help your colleagues do the same.\nAll of this, so that Netflix members can immerse themselves in the stories they care about, on the devices they love, from whichever part of the world they call home. Without the technology behind it all ever getting in the way.\nIf this resonates with you, we’d love to talk!\n# What Sets You Apart\n* You’re **eager to learn and grow** your technical skills, especially in building mobile UI architecture\n* You’re **passionate about** writing elegantly designed, **maintainable, performant software**\n* You love the idea of your work empowering other engineers\n* You have an appreciation for **diverse perspectives** and a**collaborative approach** to problem-solving.\n* You know that there is rarely a single ‘right’ solution, and are **thoughtful about trade-offs**\n* You understand that it is **really about solving problems**. A language, framework or library choice is just a means to an end.\n**Scale, Impact**\n* **Hundreds of Engineers :** You’ll be improving UI development velocity for over 100 engineers...\n* **Millions of Users :** creating best-in-class streaming UIs used by over 100M users...\n* **Thousands of Devices****:** across a wide spectrum of devices...\n* **Globally****:** in almost every country in the world.\n**Unique Technical Challenges**\nWe build framework solutions (libraries, architectures, and tools) which are flexible enough to span a variety of product use cases, across a varied client, server and network performance landscape, all while being easy to use for the engineers we support. The breadth of problems we work on provide a great career opportunity to explore different technical areas and deepen your expertise.\n**Collaboration and Communication**\nIt’s not all about the tech. We highly value the skills required to build strong relationships and collaborate effectively.\n**Responsibility and Ownership**\nWe believe in hiring responsible engineers, providing them with the business context they need, and then freeing them up to own their project’s scope, design, trade-offs, and figure out the implementation details.\nOur compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses. You choose each year how much of your compensation you want in salary versus stock options.

If you're passionate about creating equitable experiences and empowering individuals to do their best work, this role is for you.\n****What you’ll do****\nYou will help enable leaders and teams to drive creativity and innovation at Netflix by partnering with HRBPs, Talent Acquisition, and members of other Talent functions. You will drive results primarily through your partners, and you will work directly with the business teams when necessary. Your scope includes leading and managing key global inclusion initiatives in APAC alongside your regional peers (e.g., company engagement programs, employee resource groups, or learning and insights). Since you are working in a matrixed organisation, you will need to engage and communicate effectively across your local and functional stakeholders. Your key responsibilities include:\n* ****Enabling leaders to strengthen a consistent employee experience through insights and candor:**** When employees experience our culture inconsistently, their ability to do their best work suffers. The person in this role will partner with HRBPs, Talent Acquisition, and other Talent team members to support leaders when conducting comprehensive organizational reviews to ensure a consistent employee experience across the employment lifecycle. Examples include: mitigating bias in hiring and onboarding practices; spotting gaps in our feedback culture; understanding cultural barriers to inclusion of people with disabilities in the workplace. The analysis involves gathering insights from qualitative data (e.g., employee 1:1s, Focus Group Discussions, feedback, etc.) and quantitative data (e.g., sentiment surveys, employee lifecycle data, org composition metrics, etc.).\n* ****Driving business outcomes with talent peers to adapt and deliver solutions that enable inclusive leadership excellence** : **At Netflix, leaders succeed when they role model our values, build Dream Teams, and make decisions in Netflix’s long-term interests. The person in this role regularly collaborates with Talent Management peers; listens, consults, and advises with HRBPs to meet the needs of the business by curating and adapting centrally-designed solutions - or building bespoke in exceptional circumstances - guided by qualitative and quantitative insights; partners with HRBPs to execute solutions as needed. Examples include: coaching and advising HRBPs with tangible approaches for mitigating leaders’ bias in talent density decisions or the application of our compensation philosophy; partnering with HRBPs to equip leaders with inclusive leadership competencies to drive high performance and resilience within diverse teams; designing and rolling out solutions with HRBPs to enhance cross-functional collaboration in partnership with Talent Management peers.\n* ****Helping business teams scale inclusion as a business strategy** : **Creativity and innovation help Netflix maintain its competitive edge, and inclusion enables our advantage. The person in this role will be a thought partner to business colleagues as they take risks, learn, and innovate in their everyday work. Examples include: equipping teams involved in content, production, marcomms, and other Netflix business teams with tangible and actionable recommendations and good practices that help to drive excellence that delights our members; engaging employees by enhancing community, learning, and cultural understanding in the workplace through employee-led resource groups (ERGs).\n****What You'll Bring:****\n* **Experience****:** More than 5+ years in HR Business Partnering, Talent Management, or related HR roles. Cross-cultural experience in APAC is a strong advantage.\n* **Inclusion Expertise:** Deep fluency in how inclusive practices strengthen leadership competencies, team performance, cross-functional collaboration, and business outputs (e.g., events, production processes, etc). While direct experience is preferred, strong passion and a demonstrated track record of ongoing commitment in this area will also be valued.\n* **Business Partnering & Talent Management****:** Proven capability to influence, coach, and provide strategic advisory, with tangible examples of partnering on Talent Management initiatives (e.g., leadership development, performance, inclusion programs), grounded in both data and sound judgment.\n* **Learning & Organizational Development****:** Hands-on experience designing/adapting, and implementing learning strategies, leadership development programs, or organizational effectiveness initiatives that strengthen culture, inclusion, and talent density.\n* **Stakeholder & Project Management****:** Strong track record of partnering effectively across functions, geographies, and time zones.\n* **Analytical & Storytelling skills****:** Advanced ability to diagnose inconsistencies in employee experience, quantify impact, and translate insights into data-informed solutions.\n* **Talent Lifecycle Impact****:** Hands-on experience embedding inclusion across hiring, onboarding, leadership development, team effectiveness, and change management to build talent density.\n* **Market Knowledge****:** Deep understanding of the Korean talent, labor, and entertainment landscape, particularly dynamics affecting historically marginalized groups - especially people with disabilities; familiarity with labor laws across APAC is a plus.\n* **Learning Agility****:** High adaptability with a track record of leveraging employee experience and inclusion as levers for business performance and innovation.\n* **Language Skills****:** Fluency in English and Korean, with the ability to communicate complex, nuanced concepts (e.g., unconscious bias, privilege, allyship) with clarity and impact.\n****Ready to make a difference?

We love what we do and genuinely enjoy working together—whether that’s solving big comms challenges, obsessing over the details that matter (to serial comma or not to serial comma—is this even a question?!), or jamming on out-of-the-box solutions.\nAre you passionate about connecting people to culture and workplace programs that matter? We’re looking for a Manager, Internal Communications to play a key role in shaping how we engage and inspire employees. As a core member of the team leading global internal communications, you’ll report to our Senior Manager, Employee Experience, and primarily collaborate with leaders and program teams across our Talent/HR, Workplace and Finance teams. You’ll craft and deliver compelling narratives that bring our employee experience initiatives and strategic priorities to life for leaders and employees alike.\nThis role focuses on topics central to who we are and where we’re headed—such as the evolution of Netflix culture, growth and development, feedback, employee sentiment, compensation, inclusion, community engagement, and productivity tools. You’ll make these important topics relatable and relevant by reimagining creative ways to share information and engage audiences.\nWe’re seeking a strong, exceptionally organized communicator who’s also a strategic thinker—someone who connects the dots quickly, anticipates needs, and crafts effective communication approaches. You know how to ask the right questions to understand different parts of the business and build deep trust with your partners.\n**Core responsibilities:**\n* Stay connected with the business to design global communications strategies, draft executive communications, and manage organizational events.\n* Act as a strategic advisor to employee program leads, strengthening connections and long-term trust with employees.\n* Build a consistent drumbeat of conversational, easy-to-understand updates through core channels (e.g., email, Slack, intranet, podcasts, video; live and virtual events).\n* Craft thoughtful change management strategies that ensure communications drive understanding, adoption, and positive outcomes.\n* Manage the flow of communications using editorial calendars and planning tools (e.g., Asana) to ensure messages are timely and don’t overwhelm the business.\n* Move projects and plans forward collaboratively, with a sharp eye for detail and execution.\n* Propose solutions that are both flexible and scalable to the business’s evolving needs.\n* Measure our strategy to understand the impact of communications and improve how we support the business.\n**To succeed in this role, you’ll need:**\n* 7+ years of experience in communications, preferably within media, advertising, entertainment, or technology industries.\n* Excellent written and oral communication skills.\n* A firm belief that when life works, work works better—and the motivation to help employees get the most out of everything Netflix offers so that they can deliver their best performance.\n* The ability to cut through corporate jargon and deliver clear, engaging messages that answer, “Why does this matter to me?” for both employees and the business. You’re an expert simplifier.\n* Natural relationship-building skills, with the ability to collaborate across multiple teams and disciplines.\n* Comfort thriving in a fast-paced environment and working with a wide variety of internal partners.\n* A dislike of hierarchy and bureaucracy, but also an understanding that some structure—as well as the ability to plan—is needed to work effectively at our size.\nThis role is based in either our Los Angeles or Los Gatos office.\nOur compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses.
