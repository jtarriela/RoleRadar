We maintain the reliability of ML applications by building systems to catch and diagnose issues as soon as possible, sometimes before they even happen!\nThe Build and Release (B&R) group within OLM is building a novel monorepo environment to provide build, testing, CI/CD, and developer tooling for our ML engineers and researchers. Engineers enjoy standardization in build toolchains, dependency management, runtime version migrations, and documentation tooling, allowing them to focus on their work, not wrangling their tools.\nWe are seeking strong build engineers with experience with B&R best practices at scale. Our work supports B&R operations for our most critical applications, such as real-time inference services, feature computation and serving, ML model representations, and much more. You’ll play a foundational role in establishing the practices used by hundreds of engineers and ML researchers across dozens of use cases. Our team is small and growing, so you’ll mentor incoming B&R engineers as they grow into their roles supporting our organization.\nTo be successful in this role, you must have a strong software engineering background, a keen sense of software design, and experience operating large CI/CD systems.\n### **Snapshot of projects you may work on:**\n* Help make foundational technology decisions with an eye toward large-scale repository management.\n* Define best practices for large-scale monorepos, influencing how hundreds of engineers work daily.\n* Anticipate and prepare for scaling opportunities as our repository grows beyond the capabilities of existing tools, such as build time reductions, flaky test handling, build tool migrations, and more.\n* Onboard existing repositories as they enter the monorepo, including harmonizing their homegrown toolchains with our standardized offers.\n* Expand B&R support to accommodate new languages. We currently support Java and Scala, and are expanding to Python.\n* Support teams with company-wide migrations and version upgrades, such as build and runtime environment versions and library versions.\n* Work alongside company-wide build experts to incorporate existing company-wide tools into our environment.\n* Create measurement harnesses to measure build performance, mean time to failure, and other critical developer velocity metrics.\n### **We would love to work with you if:**\n* You have at least four years of experience directly managing build, CI/CD, and release tooling, preferably in a monorepo context in which these offerings are provided as a service\n* You have proficiency in managing large projects in Gradle as well as cross-language build tools such as Bazel or Pants\n* You have experience developing build and release operations for large repositories featuring dozens to hundreds of independent but interlinked projects\n* You have extensive experience with Java and/or Python B&R methodologies\n* You have a passion for evolving B&R best practices in response to empirical performance and developer velocity measurements\nOur compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses. You choose each year how much of your compensation you want in salary versus stock options. To determine your personal top-of-market compensation, we rely on market indicators and consider your specific job family, background, skills, and experience to determine your compensation in the market range.

When we do that well, Members value Netflix and continue to subscribe, despite the many other choices for entertainment. This team creates the data products that help measure this experience, track key KPIS, and support innovation decisions through A/B testing.

If yes, we are looking for you to join other stunning colleagues in Los Angeles who share a passion for continuing to build expertise in streamed content accounting.\nThis role provides you with the chance to join a team committed to transforming and redefining the perception of entertainment and how it can be enjoyed through the Netflix service. With continued investment in a slate of content, including original productions, content licensing, and international expansion, it's a great time for you to join Netflix.\nThis role is based in our Hollywood office, reporting to the management team in Content Accounting.\n**Responsibilities:**\n* Based in our Hollywood office, reporting to the management team in Content Accounting.\n* Part of the team responsible for the financial integrity of the company's content commitments, assets (capitalization), liabilities (payments), and expenses (amortization).\n* Prepare and review monthly accounting entries, reconciliations, CFO metrics, and other ad hoc analyses.\n* Management and accounting (in proprietary systems) of content license contracts and understanding the full cost of each produced show, with a focus on ensuring appropriate accounting by researching guidance.\n* Analyze content agreements and transactions (e.g. licensing contracts, talent deals, etc.), to interpret contractual terms and understand the application of our accounting policies.\n* Identify and drive process improvements and own projects such as accounting policy review.\n* Manage cross-functional relationships with teams outside of Content Accounting, including those across finance and content acquisition organizations.\n* As Netflix continues its content expansion, the accounting and operational complexities are also growing.

That’s OK with us because we’ll teach you as long as you’re excited about learning.\n* Curiosity and passion - Our team members ask probing questions, challenge the status quo, make changes to improve processes, and have fun while doing it all; a positive attitude and never settling for “good enough” is key, along with adding to our unique company culture.\n* You have strong communication skills (both written and oral) and are viewed as a strong cross-functional business partner. You should also have a strong accounting background and be comfortable navigating technical accounting guidance.\n* Collaborate inclusively - Partner with team members and authentically recognize, understand, and appreciate differences, and connect across these differences by being mutually adaptive.\n* Adaptable—You must be comfortable with an ever-changing ecosystem of content, finance, and accounting issues and projects.\n* You embrace and advocate the Netflix culture and our long-term view.\nOur compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses. You choose each year how much of your compensation you want in salary versus stock options. To determine your personal top of market compensation, we rely on market indicators and consider your specific job family, background, skills, and experience to determine your compensation in the market range. The range for this role is $50,000 - $240,000.\nWe are an equal-opportunity employer and celebrate diversity, recognizing that diversity\n* ### General Description\n* ### Essential Cookies\n* ### Performance and Functionality Cookies\n* ### Advertising Cookies\n#### General Description\nThis cookie tool will help you understand the use of cookies on this website, and how you can control the use of these cookies.\nPrivacy settings in most browsers allow you to prevent your browser from accepting some or all cookies, notify you when it receives a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether.

It supports essential product journeys such as signup, login, account management, upsells and enables teams across the company to ship faster, more consistent, and more delightful user experiences.
