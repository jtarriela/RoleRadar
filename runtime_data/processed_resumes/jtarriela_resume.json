      "description": "Directed end-to-end optimization workflows: study planning, architecture, ML model selection, ETL, scalable pipelines, feature extraction, model training, and final data analysis to inform leadership decisions. Refactored legacy MATLABFortran code into a parallelized Python HPC workflow, achieving 22 faster execution, which enabled rapid trade studies and cut program design cycles by months. Automated ETL workflows and HPC data pipelines to process terabytes of simulation outputs into structured datasets, supporting downstream analytics and ML workflows. Developed multi-fidelity optimization frameworks combining reduced-order and high-fidelity simulations to evaluate both component- and system-level performance. Implemented ML-based global surrogate models (LightGBM, CNN/U-Net prototypes) that reduced simulation wall time by orders of magnitude, accelerating design iteration. Led cross-functional teams to integrate ML optimization workflows into system-level design processes. Served as technical lead and program owner across multiple internally funded R&D efforts, contributing to over $3.2M in IRAD funding for advanced computational design and modeling. Partnered with Raytheon Technologies Research Center to integrate optimization and sensitivity analysis workflows into enterprise-level tools (DISCOVER and RCADE), enabling new product discovery and system-level optimization through campaign, system, and product studies across business units at scale."
